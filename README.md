# 💡 *Problem Statement*

With the burgeoning expansion of blockchain technologies, there is a substantial increase in the variety and volume of digital assets. These assets, whether they are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or various types of cryptocurrency tokens, represent a significant store of value. However, owners of these digital assets often find them illiquid or are unable to leverage them effectively to obtain liquidity without selling the underlying assets.

Digital asset holders, particularly those with NFTs or tokens across multiple blockchains, lack a unified, secure, and efficient platform to leverage these assets for liquidity. 

They require a solution where they can easily, securely, and efficiently borrow against their digital assets without the need to liquidate them.
